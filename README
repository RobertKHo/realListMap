This program was completed using pair programming.
Partner:  Robert Ho               (rokho@ucsc.edu)
Partner:  Daniel Urrutia          (deurruti@ucsc.edu)

We acknowledge that each partner in a programming pair should
drive roughly 50% of the time the pair is working together, and
at most 25% of an individual's effort for an assignment should
be spent working alone.  Any work done by a solitary programmer
must be reviewed by the partner.  The object is to work
together, learning from each other, not to divide the work into
two pieces with each partner working on a different piece.

Robert Ho     spent       2 hours working alone.
Daniel Urrutia spent      1 hours working alone.
We spent                 14 hours working together.
Robert Ho spent          7 hours driving.
Daniel Urrutia spent     7 hours driving.
